Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Different ways to define Fibonaccie sequence:

1. Recursion
2. Dynamic Programming
3. Space Optimized

4. Efficient Pythonic generator of the Fibonacci sequence
5. Recursively defined implementation
6. Memoized recursion for efficiency
7. Recursively defined generator:
