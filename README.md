My solutions to Project Euler problems from https://projecteuler.net/

The main goal of this project is to help me become proficient user of Python, improve my problem-solving skills and 
gain experience in algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming.

Current tasks:

[ ] Finish first 50 problems - Problems 47, 49 and 50

[ ] Refactor first 50 problems - suggestions welcome!
 - Problem 2 - explore different ways of defining Fibonacci sequence, trying to improve performance
 - Problem 5 - try to improve performance, right now takes more than 60 seconds
 - Problem 7 - try to improve performance, right now takes more than 10 seconds
 - Problem 10 - try to improve performance, right now takes more than 15 seconds
 - Problem 11 - reading from file improved, the rest of the code could be more elegant
 - Problem 12 - first problem where I used profiler, needs more exploration
 - Problem 14 - try to improve performance, right now takes more than 10 seconds
 - Problem 15 - code brute force solution
 - Problem 18 - code brute force solution
 - Problem 19
 - Problem 22
 - Problem 23
 - Problem 24 - code without using itertools
 - Problem 25 - needs changes to code structure and Fibonacci to explore code optimization
 - Problem 26
 - Problem 27 - code without using itertools
 - Problem 28 - code brute force solution
 - Problem 31
 - Problem 32 - change code structure
 - Problem 33 - change code structure
 - Problem 34 - think about the range 
 - Problem 35 - try to improve performance, right now takes more than 60 seconds
 - Problem 37
 - Problem 38
 - Problem 39
 - Problem 40
 - Problem 41 - try to improve performance, right now takes more than 60 seconds
 - Problem 42 - read data in a different way
 - Problem 43 - code without using itertools
 - Problem 44
 - Problem 45
 - Problem 46
 - Problem 47
 - Problem 48

[ ] Finish first 100 problems

 - Problem 51
 - Problem 52
 - Problem 53
 - Problem 54
 - Problem 55
 - Problem 56
 - Problem 57
 - Problem 58
 - Problem 59


[ ] Code optimization - for every problem that runs longer than 5 seconds in brute force solution add optimized solution

[ ] Change project structure - different naming scheme + move problem description to README and explain maths behind it wherever brute force solution is not sufficient
