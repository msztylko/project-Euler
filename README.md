# Project Euler

My solutions to Project Euler problems from https://projecteuler.net/

The main goal of this project is to help me become proficient user of Python, improve my problem-solving skills and 
gain experience in algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming.

## Current tasks:

- [x] Finish first 50 problems

[ ] Refactor first 25 problems 
 - Problem 2 - explore different ways of defining Fibonacci sequence, trying to improve performance
 - Problem 11 - needs better code structure
 - Problem 15 - code brute force solution
 - Problem 18 - code brute force solution
 - Problem 19 - refactor
 - Problem 22
 - Problem 23
 - Problem 24 - code without using itertools
 - Problem 25 - needs changes to code structure and Fibonacci to explore code optimization
 
 [ ] Refactor problems 26 - 50
 - Problem 26
 - Problem 27 - code without using itertools
 - Problem 28 - code brute force solution
 - Problem 31
 - Problem 32 - change code structure
 - Problem 33 - change code structure
 - Problem 34 - think about the range 
 - Problem 35 - try to improve performance, right now takes more than 60 seconds
 - Problem 37
 - Problem 38
 - Problem 39
 - Problem 40
 - Problem 41 - try to improve performance, right now takes more than 60 seconds
 - Problem 42 - read data in a different way
 - Problem 43 - code without using itertools
 - Problem 44
 - Problem 45
 - Problem 46
 - Problem 47 - terrible code that needs refactorization 
 - Problem 48
 - Problem 49 - explain logic behind the solution
 - Problem 50
 
[ ] Finish first 100 problems

 - Problem 52 - code without using itertools
 - Problem 55
 - Problem 56
 - Problem 57
 - Problem 58
 - Problem 59
 - Problem 60
 - Problem 61


[ ] Code optimization - for every problem that runs longer than 5 seconds in brute force solution add optimized solution. Collect methods used for optimization and write them down.

[ ] Change project structure - different naming scheme + move problem description to README and explain maths behind it wherever brute force solution is not sufficient.
